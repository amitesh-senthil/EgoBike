# EgoBike Mark2

EgoBike — Custom Electric Dirt Bike (Mark 2 Development)

EgoBike is a self-designed electric dirt bike project focused on learning real-world engineering: structural frame design, MIG welding, drivetrain integration, suspension geometry, CAD workflows, and cost-conscious prototyping. The repository documents my design iterations, reasoning, tradeoffs, and build decisions so others can learn from and improve on them.

## Why am I building this?

I wanted a project that would challenge me technically and force me to work through real constraints: budget, manufacturability, sourcing parts, and safety. I’ve spent years in FIRST Tech Challenge building competition robots — but this project pushes those skills into something rideable, structural, and human-scale.

## My goals with EgoBike are to:
- design a structurally sound electric dirt bike frame
- understand welding, load paths, and failure points
- integrate electronics safely and cleanly
- keep the entire prototype under a realistic budget
- document everything so others can replicate or adapt it

Along the way, I’m treating this like a real engineering product: researching regulations, validating designs in CAD, testing assumptions, and iterating instead of guessing.
