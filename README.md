# EgoBike [master sketch above]

Electric Dirt Bike project (mb for making this repo so late, just trying to document and back up stuff) 

# Why am I doing this?

I got rejected from a college and I'm building a project to prove to myself what I can do, while learning about mig welding, steel frames, suspension mechanisms and just dealing with real world factors. Primarily I've been involved in the FIRST TECH CHALLENGE and various side projects but I've never done something this big with a low budget, making me challenge myself to get it all done withing 600 or 700 dollars. Also I procrassinated getting my lisence so this can be a cool alternative 😃.

But if you are interested in checking out my other projects, heres trash talker AI, a website and real life trash can that can classify plastic film, recyclables and waste: https://trashtalker-01.streamlit.app/
